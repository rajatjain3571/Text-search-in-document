# Text-search-in-document
 search using McCreight’s algorithm is implemented. The main aim of McCreight’s algorithm is to construct suffix tree in linear time. A suffix tree of a string A, is a compressed trie of all the suffixes of the string A$. A suffix tree is a data structure which is built from a string of linear function of length of the string which is constructed in linear time.
